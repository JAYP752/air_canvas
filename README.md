## ✨ Features

- **Gesture-Based Drawing**: Draw using your index finger
- **5 Color Palette**: Choose from Purple, Blue, Green, Red, or Eraser
- **Color Selection**: Use two fingers to select colors from the palette
- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: Powered by MediaPipe for accurate detection
- **Clear Canvas**: Reset your drawing with a single keypress
- **Smooth Drawing Experience**: Optimized for fluid hand movements

## 🎮 How to Use

### Hand Gestures

- **Draw Mode**: Extend only your **index finger** to draw
- **Select Mode**: Extend both **index and middle fingers** to select colors from the top palette
- **Idle**: Keep fingers down to pause

### Keyboard Controls

- **C**: Clear the canvas
- **Q**: Quit the application

## 🖼️ Demo

When you run the application:

1. Your webcam will activate
2. Show your hand to the camera
3. Use gestures to draw or select colors from the palette at the top

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** (required for MediaPipe)
- **Webcam** (built-in or external)
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JAYP752/air_canvas.git
cd air_canvas
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📦 Dependencies

- **opencv-python** - Video capture and image processing
- **opencv-contrib-python** - Additional OpenCV functionalities
- **mediapipe** - Hand tracking and landmark detection
- **numpy** - Array operations for image manipulation

See `requirements.txt` for complete list of dependencies.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working

- Ensure your webcam is connected and not being used by another application
- Grant camera permissions to the terminal/Python

### Hand Not Detected

- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Keep your hand clearly visible to the camera
- Try adjusting the detection confidence in `main.py` (lines 10-12)

### Performance Issues

- Close other applications using the webcam
- Reduce video resolution if needed
- Ensure you're using Python 3.10+

## 🎨 Customization

You can customize the drawing experience by modifying `main.py`:

```python
# Change colors (line 17-23)
colors = [
    (255, 0, 255),  # purple
    (255, 0, 0),    # blue
    (0, 255, 0),    # green
    (0, 0, 255),    # red
    (0, 0, 0),      # Eraser
]

# Adjust hand detection sensitivity (line 10-12)
hands = mp_hands.Hands(
    max_num_hands=1,
    min_detection_confidence=0.6,  # Increase for more accuracy
    min_tracking_confidence=0.6    # Increase for smoother tracking
)

# Change brush thickness (line 105)
thickness = 60 if current_color == (0, 0, 0) else 8  # eraser : brush
```
